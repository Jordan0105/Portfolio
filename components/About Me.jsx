        Hello! My name is Yordan and I love creating stuff about coding. I
        started building webs 1 year ago and I have created some pages that I
        really enjoyed building it. I study System Engineering and I have
        knowledge of some programming languages like C, C#, Python, JavaScript,
        TypeScript and SQL (in a list)
